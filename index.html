    <h1>Claim</h1>
    <p>The mechanism of the mystery black box contains a siphon and a trap for water.</p>
    <h1>Evidence</h1>
    <p>The mystery black box is a mechanism that outputs a seemingly random amount of water 
    based on some input of water. It can be observed that identical inputs may still produce 
    varying outputs. Initially, an input of 500 mL of water produced 0 mL of water, though, for 
    other trials with the same input, the box may also output a drastically greater amount of water.
    Due to these differences in outputs, we considered that a siphon and trap were significant 
    components of the box. For trials in which the input exceeds the output, a trap can be used to 
    collect the water without dispensing much of the water; for trials in which the output exceeds 
    the input, a siphon can be used to pull extra water from the trap out of the box. In our model, 
    there are pipes of different sizes to act as both the siphons and traps connected to buckets to 
    collect and disperse the water. After testing our model, the outputs generally were the same as 
    our inputs: in one trial, an input of 300 mL of water resulted in an output of 0 mL of water, 
    though in the next trial, an input of 475 mL of water resulted in around 475 mL of water (the 
    same amount).</p>
