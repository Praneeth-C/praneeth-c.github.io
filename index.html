    <center><h1>Claim</h1></center>
    <p>The mechanism of the mystery black box contains a siphon and a trap for water.</p>
    <center><h1>Evidence</h1></center>
    <center><p>The mystery black box is a mechanism that outputs a seemingly random amount of water 
    based on some input of water. It can be observed that identical inputs may still produce 
    varying outputs. Initially, an input of 500 mL of water produced 0 mL of water, though, for 
    other trials with the same input, the box may also output a drastically greater amount of water.
    Due to these differences in outputs, we considered that a siphon and trap were significant 
    components of the box. For trials in which the input exceeds the output, a trap can be used to 
    collect the water without dispensing much of the water; for trials in which the output exceeds 
    the input, a siphon can be used to pull extra water from the trap out of the box. In our model, 
    there are pipes of different sizes to act as both the siphons and traps connected to buckets to 
    collect and disperse the water. After testing our model, the outputs generally were the same as 
    our inputs: in one trial, an input of 300 mL of water resulted in an output of 0 mL of water, 
    though in the next trial, an input of 475 mL of water resulted in around 475 mL of water (the 
      same amount).</p></center>

    <center><h1>Reasoning</h1></center>
    <p>Models are demonstrations of a system of ideas and can be represented physically (exhibits, 
    structures) or digitally (slideshows, CAD models). Models are very useful for closely 
    demonstrating the structure and purpose of a real or undeveloped idea, especially if analyzing 
    the real idea is difficult. Models allow for easier analysis of an idea, though they are 
    generally simpler than the actual object and may not produce accurate results.</p>
    <p>Since for some trials, the output exceeded the input and for some trials, the input 
    exceeded the output, it can be determined that in some cases, water is being collected and 
    prevented from exiting the box (input exceeds output) and that in some cases, extra water is 
    exiting the box, presumably by being pulled from the box (output exceeds input). For example, 
    if we observe Trials 1 and 4 in the model data, it can be seen that input of 300 mL outputs a 
    far less amount of 0 mL, and an input of 500 mL outputted a smaller amount of 400 mL; these 
    trials can relatively be compared with Trials 1 and 18 in the class data, in which an input 
    of 500 mL outputted 0 mL, and an input of 500 mL outputted 155 mL. Additionally, if we 
    observe Trials 5 and 6, an input of 650 mL outputted 650 mL, and an input of 700 mL 
    outputted 700 mL, which occurred due to the siphon extracting water from the collection out 
    of the box (and trapping additional water). These two phenomena describe the effects of a 
    trap and siphon, respectively, as a trap collects and prevents water from escaping the box 
    while a siphon extracts extra water from a collection of water and out of the box.</p>
    <p>Suppose the box did not contain either a siphon or a trap. In order to replicate the 
    overall class data of the box, the model needs to match the unique trial results in which 
    the output drastically exceeds the input or the input drastically exceeds the output 
    (examples include Trial 1 and Trial 18 for the first case and Trial 5 and Trial 17 for the 
    second case). Without either a trap or a siphon, these cases should not occur without leaking 
    or adding extra water, and the input should closely match the output without variances: no 
    water can be trapped in the box to prevent water from escaping (since there is no trap), and 
    no extra water should be escaping the box (as there is no siphon).</p>

      <figcaption>The model of the mystery black box contains several components that compose the siphon 
      and trap of the box and dispense the water out of the box. Once water is poured into the 
      funnel, the water collects in the dispersion bucket and can traverse the box either to the 
      greedy glass helix or the simple P-trap. The greedy glass helix, which acts as a siphon and 
      a trap, stores water until enough water enters it, to which water is pulled from the helix 
      into the collection bucket. The simple P-trap stores extra water until enough water pressure 
      is given to push the water out of the trap and into the collection bucket. The water then 
      accumulates in the collection bucket, and once the water level in the bucket reaches a 
      certain height, water can exit the bucket through the outlet and out of the box.</figcaption>
